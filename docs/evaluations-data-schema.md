# Evaluation benchmark data contract

This document proposes the `evaluations.ndjson` record contract consumed by the
AI Hub model-catalog service for evaluation insights. The file remains in each
model directory beside `metadata.json`. Each line represents one benchmark
result from one evaluation run.

## Proposed record

```json
{"id":"result-7f1f","model_id":"RedHatAI/example-model","run_id":"run-2026-09-17-001","evaluation":"General language evaluation","category":"general-llm","benchmark":"mmlu","description":"Measures multitask language understanding.","result":0.72,"result_metric":"accuracy","created_at":1789646400000,"updated_at":1789646460000}
```

Each NDJSON line can be validated with this JSON Schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "urn:kubeflow:catalog:evaluation-result:v1",
  "title": "Catalog evaluation result",
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "id",
    "model_id",
    "run_id",
    "evaluation",
    "category",
    "benchmark",
    "description",
    "result",
    "result_metric",
    "created_at"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "model_id": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "run_id": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "evaluation": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "category": {
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$"
    },
    "benchmark": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "description": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "result": { "type": "number" },
    "result_metric": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "created_at": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 0 },
    "updated_at": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 0 }
  },
  "additionalProperties": true
}
```

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Yes | Globally unique, stable identifier for this benchmark result. |
| `model_id` | string | Yes | Exact match for the sibling `metadata.json` `id`; includes the provider/namespace and model name. |
| `run_id` | string | Yes | Stable identifier shared by all benchmark results produced by one evaluation run. |
| `evaluation` | string | Yes | Human-readable evaluation or collection name shown in the UI. |
| `category` | string | Yes | Stable, lowercase kebab-case category identifier, such as `general-llm`, `safety-testing`, or `software-engineering`. |
| `benchmark` | string | Yes | Stable benchmark identifier, such as `mmlu` or `ifeval`. |
| `description` | string | Yes | Human-readable explanation of what the evaluation or benchmark measures. |
| `result` | number | Yes | Finite numeric result. Producers must not encode the number as a string. |
| `result_metric` | string | Yes | Unit or metric needed to interpret `result`, such as `accuracy`, `accuracy-percent`, or `pass-rate`. |
| `created_at` | integer | Yes | Evaluation result timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds. |
| `updated_at` | integer | No | Last update timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds. |

Producers may append optional scalar properties. Suggested optional properties
include `provider_id`, `benchmark_url`, `higher_is_better`, and
`execution_context`. New required properties need a coordinated contract change.

## Producer migration

For current Model Validation records:

- Rename `score` to `result`.
- Rename `score_metric` to `result_metric`.
- Add `run_id`, `evaluation`, `category`, and `description`.
- Preserve `id`, `model_id`, `benchmark`, `execution_context`, `created_at`,
  and `updated_at`.

During rollout, producers may temporarily emit both the old and new score field
names. The catalog accepts `result` for the existing aggregate accuracy view as
well as for detailed evaluation results.

## Validation and correlation rules

- `model_id` must exactly equal the sibling `metadata.json` `id`. Directory
  placement alone is not sufficient correlation.
- `id` identifies one benchmark result; `run_id` groups results belonging to the
  same evaluation execution.
- A file may contain multiple records for the same benchmark when they have
  different `id` values. This is how run history is retained.
- Producers must retain historical records needed by the UI rather than writing
  only the latest score.
- Duplicate `id` values, missing required fields, non-numeric results, invalid
  timestamps, and records whose `model_id` does not match `metadata.json` are
  invalid.
- When present, `updated_at` must not precede `created_at`.
- Category identifiers are API/filter values. Presentation labels and badge
  colors remain UI concerns.

## Compatibility

Legacy records containing only `benchmark` and `score` continue to feed the
existing aggregate `accuracy-metrics` artifact. The model-catalog service emits
record-level `evaluation-metrics` artifacts only for records satisfying this
contract. This permits the BenchmarkDataImage producer and consumer to roll out
independently without breaking existing accuracy consumers.

The model-catalog API represents `created_at` and `updated_at` as the artifact's
standard timestamps. All other record fields are returned as typed custom
properties on a `CatalogMetricsArtifact` whose `metricsType` is
`evaluation-metrics`.
